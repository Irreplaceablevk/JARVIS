🤖 JARVIS AI – Your Personal Virtual Assistant
JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a Python-based voice assistant project inspired by the fictional AI from Iron Man. This intelligent assistant is designed to perform a variety of tasks using speech recognition and automation tools.

💡 Features:
🎙️ Voice Recognition – Listens and responds to user commands

🌐 Web Search – Opens websites, searches Google, YouTube, Wikipedia

🕒 Time & Date – Announces the current time and date

📧 Email Sending – Sends emails via voice command

📂 File Access – Opens files and applications

🧠 AI Conversations – Basic conversational abilities using pre-trained models or logic

🔊 Text-to-Speech (TTS) – Speaks responses using pyttsx3

🛠 Tech Stack:
Python

speech_recognition

pyttsx3 for speech synthesis

wikipedia, webbrowser, smtplib for online features

os, datetime for system control

🚀 How It Works:
Launch the JARVIS script

Speak a command such as:

“What’s the time?”

“Search Python on Google”

“Open Notepad”

“Send an email to John”

JARVIS processes the input and performs the action in real-time

🧪 Example Commands:
“Play a song on YouTube”

“Tell me a joke”

“What’s the weather today?” (can be integrated with API)

🔐 Future Improvements:
Integrate OpenAI or GPT models for smarter conversations

Add facial recognition for user authentication

Control IoT devices and home automation systems

Build GUI using PyQt or Tkinter

📁 Project Structure:
jarvis.py – Main voice assistant script

commands/ – Additional modules or utilities

assets/ – Audio or configuration files

This project is a great starting point for building intelligent assistants and learning about voice interaction, NLP, and automation in Python.
